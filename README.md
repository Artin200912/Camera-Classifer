# Camera Classifier with GUI and Machine Learning

This project introduces a Camera Classifier that utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for user interaction, and leverages the power of Scikit-learn for machine learning model training and prediction. The application captures images from your camera, allows you to label them, trains a model based on your labeled data, and provides a platform to test the model's accuracy on new images.

## Features

- **Camera Integration**: Captures images directly from your camera.
- **Labeling System**: Enables you to label captured images for training.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model using Scikit-learn based on your labeled data.
- **Prediction Testing**: Allows you to test the trained model on new images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter for GUI
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- OpenCV for camera integration

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Artin200912/Camera-Classifer.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```
cd Camera-Classifer
```
3. **Install the required packages:**
```
pip install -r req.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the application using Python:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
   - The application will open a GUI window. Use the camera to capture images and label them as required.
   - Once you have labeled enough images, the application will train the model.
   - After training, you can test the model's accuracy on new images.
